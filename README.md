# SOLID principle practice project

This project is for learning purposes only.

## Single Responsibility Principle
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. 
In other words, a class should have only one job. 

## Open/Closed Principle
The Open/Closed Principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the functionality of the program.

## Interface Segregation Principle
The Interface Segregation Principle states that a client should not be forced to implement an interface that it does not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle
The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. 
Both should depend on abstractions.
